1.Why main() has been declared as public static void?
-------------------------------------------------------------
A:>"public": This keyword makes the main() function accessible from outside of the class in which it is defined. 
    This is necessary because the operating system or runtime environment needs to be able to access 
    the function to start the program.
    
    "static": This keyword indicates that the main() function is a class-level method, 
    which means that it can be called without creating an instance of the class. 
    This is necessary because the operating system or runtime environment needs 
    to be able to call the function before any objects are created.
    
    "void": This keyword indicates that the main() function does not return a value.
     This is because the operating system or runtime environment does not expect the function to return a value, 
     and it is not necessary for the function to do so.
     
2. Can we change the order of public static void to static public void or public void static?
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Ans:> Yes, but we can't keep public void static becoz we can change  but return type should be before method name.

3. Can we override the main() ?
------------------------------------
Ans:> yes we can but not recomented, If you declare the main() is static we can't override in that class and also can't over ride in child class.

4. can we overload the main method?
------------------------------------------
Ans:> Yes, we can by passing different arrguments.
